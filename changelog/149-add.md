# Add support for cross note links

You can reference other notes by using the markdown filename as target location.

This e.g. will point to our 'fill command' note.
```markdown
[Snage Fill](62-add.md)
```
[Snage Fill](62-add.md)

To navigate to a heading in another note, use the markdown filename followed by a `#` and the heading name.
```markdown
[Sub header "First" in relative links](149-add-relative.md#first)
```
[Sub header "First" in relative links](149-add-relative.md#first)
